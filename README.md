## Stock-Predictor
Web application which assists users in making investment decisions in the stock market. This assistance is provided by performing future short-term and long-term stock price predictions using Polynomial Curve Fitting and Artificial Neural Networks respectively in the application background. Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a companyâ€™s stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. Predicting the stock market with 100% precision is impossible, but we can still manage to develop some analysis techniques to improve our understanding of the market and make better decisions in our investments.
